The Heroku server for this has since been shut down.  But when it was up, all you'd have to do is go to the url from your phone and it'd pair you randomly with someone else who was accessing the game's url, as well.  Once paired you will be faced with a flash card of a Spanish word and multiple choice English options that you had to answer before the other player to get the point.

The back-end is Ruby-on-Rails.  Front end is Backbone.js.  It uses WebSockets for the real-time 2-way communication with the server.

I was on a small team of four that wrote this after-hours for an education innovation competition.  We won 2nd place.

I wrote the front-end, someone did the UI comps and design, someone did the Rails backend, with the other helping where needed.

public/javascripts is where the magic happens that I worked on.
